            <h1>Designing An App for Scheduling Hair Styling Appointments</h1> 
            <p class ="sub">This project is an exploration of a human-centred approach to digitizing booking appointment with a hairstylist. 
                The project was inspired by the question "What if there was an online product that allows me to book a hairstylists 
                appointment around me?"</p>
            <p>It was exciting to design such an app, however, it was important to understand the relevance of the product to the intended users, 
                the purpose of the product, and whether the most effective approach to designing the product was an App.</p>
            <p>The product was intended to serve women on the African continent and I conducted research to better understand women from 
                different regions of the continent.</p>
            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>The research methods used in this project was user interviews and secondary (online) research.</p>
            <p>User interview was chosen as interviewing is an opportunity to gain qualitative insight into how online interactions shape the way 
                women interact with their hair and make decisions about their hair. As the product was targeted at African women, I reached out to 
                students in my school (a pan-African institution) to understand the perspectives of women from different regions on the continent. 
                9 people responded to my request for an interview. The research was conducted with their consent and understanding of the goal of 
                the interview i.e the purpose of collecting information from them.</p>
            <p>The research question:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>"How does online interaction currently influence decisions women make with their hair?"</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The interview questions and transcripts are available <a href="http://bit.ly/hairResearchQuestions" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>To complement the interviews, I conducted secondary research to better understand internet consumers in Africa. Major findings from the secondary 
                research are available here <a href="http://bit.ly/secondaryResearch" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>From the information gathered from the interview and secondary research, user groups were identified and personas created for each user group. 
                The personas are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://userforge.com/view/8Pojac6rYKpBEq6T9" target="_blank">The Googlers</a>(Quick to search online for their needs): <p>They are very trusting 
                    of the internet and online reviews. Heavily influenced by e-culture in their decision-making. Love convenience. Have made purchases online. Trust-level: 
                    High.</p></li>
                <li><a href="https://userforge.com/view/fnKsMZisMNAcAbugH" target="_blank">The E-skeptics</a>(Very skeptical of reviews they see online): <p>They have made a few 
                    online purchases and will consider making more. Moderately influenced by e-culture and Ads. Sees Ads online and goes offline to purchase. Trust-level: 
                    Moderate.</p></li>
                <li><a href="https://userforge.com/view/9kPu9Wb9FWyKYc68k" target="_blank">The Unwilling</a>(Would rather make the decision physically): <p>They have never made an online 
                    purchase and highly doubts will consider making one. Values quality or certainty over convenience. Trust-level: Low.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>The information gathered from the user interviews was a lot and to make sense of this information, I used the card sorting method to group the information into buckets. With 
                this, I was able to identify themes in the responses I got from the interviews.</p>
            <img src="../img/research_user.jpg" style="width: 60%;">
            <p>From the, card sort, the following were recurring themes from the interview:</p>
            <ol>
                <h3><li>Trust</li></h3>
                <p>From the interviews, most of the participants hinted they reach out to people they are close to (friends, family) whenever they want to decide on a hairstylist. Also, 
                    after the first meeting with a hairstylist, depending on the quality of the service, they are likely to become repeat-customers. They were more likely to trust 
                    recommendations from a familiar person because of the trust built in the relationship.</p>
                <h3><li>Credibility</li></h3>
                <p>The main convincing factor in whether or not they decided to visit a hairstylist was the quality of service - as a repeat-customer or from a referral. This shows they are more
                    likely to trust hairstylists who deliver quality service. </p>
                <h3><li>Convenience</li></h3>
                <p>Picking a hairstylist is not considered a heinous task. In the absence of a familiar person to introduce them to a hairstylist, some of the participants decided based on social media pictures 
                    of a hairstylist. Also, before picking a hairstyle, participants usually search on social media platforms e.g Pinterest, Instagram for hairstyles to decide on what hairstyle to make.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>Also, from the secondary research Android over iOS. Design for Android.</p>
            <h2>Product Design Focus</h2>
            <p>The goal of the product is to embody trust, credibility and convenience in the process of designing the product. The recurring themes from the user interviews raised the following questions:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>"How do I design this product to gain user trust?"</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>"How do I communicate the convenience of the App's functionality in the design?"</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This led to the decision to focus on the booking and recommendation, onboarding and search experience in the design. The onboarding process is aimed at communication the essence of the product to 
                its users and gain their trust. The recommendation process is aimed at showing the credibility of the hairstylist. The booking and recommendations process is designned to be a niche process that 
                recognizes the context of the hair industry and creates a convenient experience for users. </p>
