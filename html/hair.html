            <h1>Designing An App for Scheduling Hair Styling Appointments</h1> 
            <p class ="sub">This project was an exploration to create an online experience around booking appointments with 
                a hairstylist. The design was inspired by the question "What if an app allows me to book a hairstylists 
                appointment around me?"</p>
            <p>The product was intended to focuse on women in the African continent as there were other Apps with a similar functionality 
                but are not available on the African market e.g Booksy and StyleSeat.</p>
            <h2>Interviews and Observations</h2>
            <p>The form of user research chosen was interviews because gathering qualitative data will be an opportunity to understand how online interactions 
                influence decision women make with their hair and design the experience for the conceptual product I envision with this understanding. Since the 
                product was targeted at African women, I reached out to students in my school (a panAfrican institution). I reached out to atleast 2 people from 
                each region on the African continent.9 out of 11 people I reached out to agreed to an interview. The interview was conducted with their consent 
                and an understanding of the goal of the interview i.e the purpose for collecting information from them.</p>
            <p>The research question:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>"How does online interaction currently influence decisions women make with their hair?"</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
