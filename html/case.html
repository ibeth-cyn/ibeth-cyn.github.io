                <p>Cellulant is a Payment Platform Infrastructure Service 
                    Provider that creates homegrown digital payments technology 
                    for African markets. It provides the platform that powers the 
                    internet of payments with dominant market position across 12 Sub-Saharan countries.</p><br>
                <p>The company was re-branding one of its digital products from Mula to Tingg and wanted 
                    a website to communicate the re-brand and communicate features of Tingg. I worked 
                    remotely with the Cellulant team alongside two other designers (Ariyike Adetimehin and Debbie Adejumo) 
                    on this project. The project was a 1-week project and the process was condensed to 
                    produce the best results given the time.</p><br>
                <p>The project brief was to: <i><strong>"build a 5-page website that represents the Tingg Brand and 
                    uses color and design to communicate to our Consumers, Businesses and developers."</i></strong> </p>
            </div>
            <div class="details details-2">
                <p>The process to achieving the goal of this project was a 4-step process, namely:</p><br>
                    <strong><p>1. Understanding Tingg:Research</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>2. Analysing the Findings</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>3. Ideation</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>4. Final Design</p></strong>
            </div>
            <div class="details details-3">
                <p>To better create a website that effectively communicates Tingg's rebrand, it was important 
                    to understand Tingg's history, its product offerings, the user groups and the message Cellulant
                     was trying to communicate to its users.</p><br>
                     <p>To achieve this, we conducted both primary and secondary research.</p><br>
                    <strong><p>Primary Research</p></strong>
                    <p>This was based on research already conducted by Cellulant to understand its user preferences 
                        and shared with us upon request.</p>
                    <br><strong><p>Secondary Research</p></strong>
                    <p>1. Internet search to understand users</p>
                    <p>2. Google Playstore reviews</p>
            </div>
            <div class="details details-4">
                <strong><p>Findings</p></strong>
                <p>1. Cellulant had two brands (mula and tingg) with similar products offerings and was merging these 
                    brands into Tingg.</p>
                <p>2. Tingg's product offerings varies from country to country</p>
                <p>3. From the Google Playstore reviews, we realised that users were comfortable with the older version 
                    of the App and were hesitant about the brand change.</p>
                <br><strong><p>Analysis</p></strong>
                <p> Our focus was on reassuring the users that the changes made to the app and brand were
                    beneficial. Finding out that the unique value proposition varied across countries, 
                    these differences were highlighted in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way.</p>
                    <p>The ‚ÄúTingg Brand Guide‚Äù inspired the colour palette and design choices.</p>

                <p>We held a brainstorm session and consolidated ideas for the information architecture and site map. 
                    As soon as we agreed on wireframes, we assigned each member of the team, tasks. I was responsible for
                    writing the micro-copies and Ariyike and Debbie handled the UI design.</p><br>

                <p>The following are ways to improve on the design given a longer time frame:</p><br>

                    <p>1. Conduct primary research to better understand the user needs.</p>
                    <p>2. Design a mobile-friendly prototype as the primary users use their phones for surfing the web.</p>
                    <p>3. Develop a dynamic hi-fi prototype to show interactions with the website.</p>
                    <p>4. Test our prototypes with actual users and iterate our design based on insights gathered
                         from observing the users.</p>
                    <p>5. Based on the feedback received, it was recommended that we incorporate more of Tingg‚Äôs features
                        on the ‚Äúour services‚Äù page for instance, lending, virtual cards, checkout etc. The decision we 
                        reached was to incorporate this in the next iteration.</p>
