                    <p>The African Leadership Academy (ALA) is a residential, secondary institution founded to transform 
                        Africa by identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders.</p><br>
                        <p>The human resources team had a challenge: on every job posting, they received a large number of 
                        applications and very few quality applications. The goal of this project was to update the 
                        hiring page to communicate the essence of working with ALA and attract top-talent.</p><br>
                        <p>The project brief was to: <i> <strong>"brainstorming, creating and prototyping different interactive 
                            interfaces for our career page. The new career page should explicitly communicate the type of employees 
                            we are and the type of employee we are seeking."</i></strong> </p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="details details-2">
                    <p>The role was remote and involved close collaboration with the Human resouces team. I worked closely with 
                        the hiring manager as a UX designer, Information Architect, UX Writer and content strategist.</p> <br>
                        <p>I worked on the site structure, copies, prototypes and met with the HR team regularly for feedback 
                        and review of the prototypes and its content.</p>

                <div class="details details-3">
                    <p>The process to achieving the goal of this project was a 4-step process, namely:</p><br>
                    <strong><p>1. Research</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>2. Analysing the Findings</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>3. Information Architecture</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>4. Prototyping & Copywriting</p></strong>

                    <p>To understand who an ideal ALA job-applicant is, it was important to learn from the following perspectives:</p><br>
                    <p><strong>Current ALA Staff and Faculty members:</strong>To understand the staff and faculty motivation for working 
                        with ALA as well as the organization culture.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Human resources team:</strong>To understand the expectation of ALA hires as well as ALA's hiring process.</p><br>
                    <p>User interviews were the most appropriate way of exploring these two viewpoints as it is an opportunity to listen and 
                        understand the motivations and expectations of ALA hires. Due to the fact that I was working remotely, setting up 
                        an interview with the current staff and faculty posed a challenge, I opted for watching and listening to the welcome 
                        video for new hires featuring current ALA staff and faculty. The video gave me insight into the working culture and 
                        motivation of ALA staff and faculty. The insights gathered was documented in a table and can be seen below:</p><br>
                    <img src="../images/ideal.PNG">
                    <p>I also interviewed the hiring manager to understand the expectations of ALA staff and faculty and there was a strong overlap 
                        with the insights gathered from the staff and faculty welcome video.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="details designs details-5">
                    <p>The expectations of the human resources team were established and these helped define the site requirements 
                        with an awareness of the ideal candidates ALA recruitment.</p><br>
                        <p>The main requirements are:</p><br>

                <div class="details details-6">
                    <p>The hiring manager and I looked at other recruitment pages and we saw the common trend: all the recruitment 
                        pages were very detailed. Some organisations communicated more than others, but  we observed a strong focus 
                        on the structure and layout of the contents on the hiring pages. </p><br> 
                        <p>We also found another commonality: sorting job openings into categories. We particularly loved this section 
                            on <a href="https://www.novapioneer.com/careers/">
                            Nova Pioneer's</a> career page, in which an 
                        overview of the categories was grouped into teaching, training and support teams, as it was a bore similarity 
                        to our objective.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="details details-7">
                    <p>
                        I worked with the team to come up with a new site structure using lo-fi prototypes. A total number of 
                        5 pages was sketched to capture the new hiring page experience. These sketches were shared with the 
                        team using Dropbox. There were also prototypes created for mobile browsers as one of the requirements 
                        of the page was responsiveness. </p><br>
                        <p>Dropbox was the main tool for collaborating because everyone working 
                        on the project was comfortable with using the platform. This allowed them drop their feedback on the 
                        documents. At the same time, the Dropbox document versioning feature was very useful as the team could 
                        easily compare and contrast different versions of the prototypes in real-time.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="details details-8">
                    <p>Once I was aligned with the team on the structure of the site, I moved on to high fidelity prototyping(using AdobeXD) 
                        and copywriting. I worked with the existing colours and fonts for the overall African Leadership Academy website.</p><br>
                        <p>Similar to the Information Architecture process, Dropbox was used as the tool for getting feedback and reviewing the 
                        prototypes and copies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="details details-9">
                    <p>Dropbox was the tool for gathering feedback and collaborating with the team. 
                        As the team did not have a developer on the ground at the time of re-designing the page, asides from 
                        the prototypes, I created a few documents to give the developer enough context if I am unavailable at 
                        the time the project is implemented. These documents include:</p><br>
                    <p><strong>1. </strong>A PDF document containing all the copies.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. </strong>A diagram of the tree of all the links on the site.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. </strong>An internal document containing information for usability testing and site maintenance.</p>

                <div class="details details-10">
                    <p>The re-design has not been rolled out at the moment. However, once it is implemented, it will be found
