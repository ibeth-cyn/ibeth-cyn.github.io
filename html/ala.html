            <h1>Re-designing the Hiring Page Experience for the African Leadership Academy</h1> 
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The African Leadership Academy (ALA) is a residential, secondary institution founded to transform Africa by identifying, developing, and connecting the next generation of African leaders.</p>            
            <p>The team had a challenge: they received a high volume of application and very few quality applications on every job posting. The hiring page at the time only listed open roles and skills required on these roles. The goal of this project was to re-design the hiring page to effectively communicate to job-seekers the expectations of a job-applicant as well as increase the productivity of the HR team.</p>
            <h2>The Brief</h2>  
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>Brainstorming, creating and prototyping different interactive interfaces for our career page. The new career page should explicitly communicate the type of employees we are and the type of employee we are seeking.</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>The role was remote and involved close collaboration with the HR team. I worked closely with the Hiring Manager as a UX designer, Information Architect, UX Writer and content strategist. I decided on the site structure, copies, prototypes and met with the HR team regularly for feedback and review of the prototypes and its content.</p>
            <h2>The process</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Understanding ALA's ideal job-applicant</li></h3>
                        <p>To understand who an ideal ALA job-applicant is, it was important to learn from the following perspectives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Current ALA Staff and Faculty members: To understand the staff and faculty motivation for working with ALA as well as the organization culture.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The HR team: To understand the expectation of ALA hires as well as ALA's hiring process.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The most suitable form of research to understand these two perspectives was user interviews as this is an opportunity to listen and understand the motivations and expectations of ALA hires. Due to the fact that I was working remotely and setting up an interview with the current staff and faculty posed a challenge, I opted for watching and listening to the welcome video for new hires featuring current ALA staff and faculty. The video gave me insight into the working culture and motivation of ALA staff and faculty. The insights gathered was documented in a table and can be seen below:</p>

                        <p>I also interviewed the hiring manager to understand the expectations of ALA staff and faculty and there was a strong overlap with the insights gathered from the staff and faculty welcome video.</p>
                    <h3><li>Defining User Goals</li></h3>
                    <h3><li>Analysing other Hiring Pages</li></h3>
                        <p>The HR manager and I looked into other hiring pages and </p>
                    <h3><li>Information Architecture</li></h3>
                    <h3><li>Prototyping and CopyWriting</li></h3>
                    <h3><li>Documentation</li></h3>
                </ol>
            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p><dfn>"This is awesome."</dfn></p>
                <p><dfn>"This is good and will be handed over to the developer for implementation."</dfn></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2>The Outcome</h2>
            <p>The re-design has not been rolled out at the moment. However, once it is implemented, it will be found <a href="http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org/get-involved/join-our-team/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
